# Reports and Security Update

## Changes Implemented

### 1. New Reports Tab
- **Aggregated Analytics:** Created a modern "one-pager" report view that aggregates task data.
- **Branch Logic:** Automatically categorizes tasks into branches (GGR, LKO, AHM) based on manager emails (`tushar.ahuja`, `aryan.mishra`, `akash.avasthi`).
- **Visuals:** Implemented a card-based layout with distinct gradients for each region, showing "Interviews" count and a status breakdown progress bar.

### 2. Password Protection
- **Global Lock:** The entire dashboard (Anomaly Monitor, Validations, and Reports) is now protected.
- **Security Check:** Requires the password `Hkpatel@21` to unlock.
- **Persistence:** Access is remembered for the session, so you don't need to re-enter it on every refresh (until the session expires).

### 3. Validations Tab
- **Data Quality:** Added a tab to validate tasks for "Today's Interview".
- **Rules:** Checks specifically for formatting issues in Subject, Candidate Name, and other fields.

## Verification Results

### Automated Browser Testing
We verified the following flows:
1.  **Access Restriction:** The dashboard correctly shows a "Access Restricted" modal on load.
2.  **Invalid Login:** Entering a wrong password displays an error message.
3.  **Successful Unlock:** Entering `Hkpatel@21` unlocks the interface.
4.  **Reports Data:** The Reports tab loads and correctly displays regional data (GGR, LKO, AHM).
5.  **Tab Navigation:** Switching between Monitor, Validations, and Reports works smoothly.

### Visual Proof
