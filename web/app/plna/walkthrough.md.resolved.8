# Walkthrough - Mismatch Tab Refinement

I have refined the **Mismatch Tab** to match the high standards of the Anomaly Monitor and Task Feed.

## Key Changes

### 1. Performance: Streaming Data
- **Implementation**: Converted `/api/mismatches` to stream data using **NDJSON**.
- **Benefit**: The page now loads progressively, showing tasks as they are processed instead of waiting for the entire set. This significantly improves perceived performance.

### 2. Enhanced UI & Usability
- **Reply Modal Integration**: Replaced the inline "evidence" toggle with the powerful [ReplyModal](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Projects/Interview%20Task%20Status%20Checker/web/components/ReplyModal.tsx#19-223).
    - View full email conversation history.
    - **Edit Round**: You can now correct the "Current Round" directly from the modal header.
- **Card Layout**:
    - **Left**: Candidate Name, Status, Subject (with Copy button), and Mismatch Badge.
    - **Center**: "Extracted Round" acts as the source of truth (or "Not Found").
    - **Right**: "Current Round" is now a direct dropdown selector for immediate fixes.
- **Visuals**:
    - Removed the "ID Badge" as requested to declutter the view.
    - Added "Date of Interview" display.
    - Aligned colors and spacing with the main design system.

### 3. Backend Validation
- **Usage**: Parsing the streaming response in [MismatchFeed.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Projects/Interview%20Task%20Status%20Checker/web/components/MismatchFeed.tsx).
- **Validation**: Ensure only valid rounds from `ALLOWED_ROUNDS` are saved to the database.

## Verification
- **Manual Test**:
    1. Open Mismatch Tab.
    2. Confirm data streams in (cards appear one by one).
    3. Click "View Evidence" -> Modal opens with replies.
    4. Change round in Modal dropdown -> Updates UI.
    5. Change round in Card dropdown -> Updates UI.
