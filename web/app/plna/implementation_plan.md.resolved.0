# Fix Status Dropdown Issue

## Goal Description
The "Statuses dropdown" is missing the "Rescheduled" status option, although it is supported in the styling logic. This plan aims to add the missing status to the dropdown.

## Proposed Changes
### Web
#### [MODIFY] [StatusBadge.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Projects/Interview%20Task%20Status%20Checker/web/components/StatusBadge.tsx)
- Add "Rescheduled" to `STATUS_OPTIONS` constant.
- Use the same orange styling defined in [getColor](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Projects/Interview%20Task%20Status%20Checker/web/components/StatusBadge.tsx#12-24) for the new option: `bg-orange-50 text-orange-700 hover:bg-orange-100`.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- None. This is a UI constant update.

### Manual Verification
1.  Open the web application.
2.  Locate a task status badge.
3.  Click on the badge to open the dropdown.
4.  Verify that "Rescheduled" appears in the list.
5.  Select "Rescheduled" and verify the badge captures the status and updates the color to orange.
