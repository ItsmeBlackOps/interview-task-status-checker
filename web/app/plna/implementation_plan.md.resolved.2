# Implement Reports Tab & Tab Security

## Goal Description
Implement a "Reports" tab that aggregates interview data by Branch (GGR, LKO, AHM) and Interview Round. The report should look modern and beautiful (one-pager style). Additionally, implement password protection for accessing tabs as requested.

## User Review Required
- **Branch Logic**: `sender` OR `cc` contains "tushar.ahuja" (GGR), "aryan.mishra" (LKO), "akash.avasthi" (AHM).
- **Password Protection**: The user request "in another tab also in previous two tabs password is required ... while this report tab is open" is interpreted as enforcing a password check (`Hkpatel@21`) when accessing restricted tabs. I will implement a mechanism to lock specific tabs.

## Proposed Changes
### Backend
#### [NEW] [app/api/reports/route.ts](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Projects/Interview%20Task%20Status%20Checker/web/app/api/reports/route.ts)
-   Fetch all tasks.
-   Helper to determine Branch:
    -   `GGR`: `tushar.ahuja`
    -   `LKO`: `aryan.mishra`
    -   `AHM`: `akash.avasthi`
-   Aggregate data: `{ [Branch]: { [Round]: { [Status]: count } } }`.

### Frontend
#### [MODIFY] [app/page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Projects/Interview%20Task%20Status%20Checker/web/app/page.tsx)
-   Add `Reports` to `activeTab` state.
-   Add `PasswordProtection` state/modal.
-   Require password when switching to tabs based on rules (Interpretation: Lock all, or lock Monitor/Validations if Reports is open? I will implement a generic lock that can be applied to any tab).

#### [NEW] [components/ReportsFeed.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Projects/Interview%20Task%20Status%20Checker/web/components/ReportsFeed.tsx)
-   UI for the report.
-   Use Grid/Masonry layout for "One Pager" feel.
-   Cards for each Branch -> Inner cards/lists for Rounds.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
1.  Verify `/api/reports` returns correct aggregations.
2.  Verify Reports UI rendering (modern styling).
3.  Verify Password Prompt works for "Hkpatel@21".
