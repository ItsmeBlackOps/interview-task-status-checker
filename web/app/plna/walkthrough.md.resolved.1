# Walkthrough - Reports Date Filter & Monitor Enhancements

I have successfully implemented the requested enhancements for the Reports tab and Anomaly Monitor.

## Changes

### 1. Interactive Reports with Date Filtering
*   **Added Date Pickers:** The Reports tab now features "From Date" and "To Date" inputs in the header.
*   **Filtering Logic:** The system correctly parses the string-based "Date of Interview" field to filter tasks by the selected date range.
*   **Robustness:** Fixed a critical crash issue by ensuring correct React Hook ordering in [ReportsFeed.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Projects/Interview%20Task%20Status%20Checker/web/components/ReportsFeed.tsx).

### 2. Anomaly Monitor Enhancements
*   **Copy Subject:** Added a dedicated copy button next to the Candidate Name in the task list.
*   **Hover Interaction:** The button appears on hover to keep the UI clean, with a tooltip showing the full subject line.

## User Interface

### Reports Tab (Filtered)
The Reports tab now allows you to view analytics for specific timeframes (e.g., after Dec 25, 2025).

### Copy Subject Feature
A new clipboard icon appears when hovering over a task, allowing quick access to the subject line.

## Validation Results
*   **Date Filter:** Verified that setting a date range correctly refreshes the report data without errors.
*   **Copy Button:** Confirmed that the button appears on hover and triggers the clipboard action.
*   **Stability:** Resolved a "React Hook Order" error to ensure the Reports tab loads reliably.
